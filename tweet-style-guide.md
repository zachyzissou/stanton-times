# The Stanton Times - WSJ-Style Tweet Guide

**Goal:** Professional, punchy, authoritative. Think Wall Street Journal meets the frontier.

---

## The WSJ Formula

### 1. Strong Ledes
Lead with the news, not the background. The first sentence should hit.

**❌ Weak:**
> "CIG has announced that after months of development, the new Alpha 4.6 patch is now available for all players to download and enjoy."

**✅ Strong:**
> "Alpha 4.6 is live. Server meshing just went from demo to reality."

### 2. No Fluff
Every word earns its place. Cut anything that doesn't add value.

| Cut This | Why |
|----------|-----|
| "It's worth noting that..." | Just note it |
| "As you may know..." | Assume nothing |
| "Interestingly enough..." | Let readers decide |
| "We're excited to report..." | Report, don't emote |
| "At this time..." | Just say "now" |

### 3. Authoritative Tone
We don't hedge unnecessarily. We state facts confidently.

**❌ Hedgy:**
> "It seems like CIG might be planning to release Pyro sometime soon, possibly in the next update."

**✅ Authoritative:**
> "CIG targets Pyro for Alpha 4.7. Development enters final sprint."

---

## Engagement Hooks

### Questions (Use Sparingly)
End major news with a question to prompt replies:

> "Alpha 4.6 drops tomorrow with 47 ship rebalances. Which hull are you checking first?"

> "Server meshing just doubled player caps. Is this the patch that changes everything?"

### Calls to Action
- "Drop your first impressions below."
- "Sound off: is this enough?"
- "Tell us what you're grinding first."
- "Bookmark this thread—we'll update as details emerge."

### Contrarian Takes (Careful)
WSJ isn't afraid to challenge consensus when warranted:

> "Everyone's talking about the new Drake ship. The real story? That buried roadmap update."

## Link Formatting

**Always include source links.** Credibility = citations.

### Format Options
1. **Inline (preferred for single source):**
   > Full details: robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/...

2. **Labeled (for multiple sources):**
   > 🔗 Official: [link]
   > 🔗 Patch notes: [link]

3. **Thread final tweet:**
   > Sources:
   > • Official announcement: [link]
   > • Dev tracker: [link]
   > • Our analysis: [link]

### Shortening
- Use native URLs when possible (Twitter auto-shortens)
- Avoid third-party shorteners (look spammy)

---

## Bullet Point Guidelines

Use bullets for:
- Patch note summaries (5+ items)
- Feature lists
- Comparison points
- Pros/cons

Format:
```
• Point one
• Point two
• Point three
```

**NOT:**
```
- Point one
- Point two
```

Twitter renders `•` cleaner than `-`.
